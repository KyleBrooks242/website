## It started with frustration

After spending an entire day of tinkering, I **still** couldn't get formatting to work

```typescript

//This was shamelessly copied for the purposes of this demo
import axios, { AxiosRequestConfig } from "axios";
import { InitializationOptions, MetricResponse, RestartResponse } from "./types";


```

And there ya have it.
