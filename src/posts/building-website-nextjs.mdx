## Background and Inspiration

A common thread among all the developers I look up to is that just about every one of has their own webpage. 
For some reason the thought of creating a webpage has always been daunting to me. 
Not only do I lack an eye for UX/UI, but I also find myself quicly overwhelmed by the sheer number of options out there.
It's 'easy' to turn to something such as [Wix](https://www.wix.com/), [SquareSpace](https://www.squarespace.com/), or [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), and there's nothing wrong
with that at all. But for me, I want to do it all. I want to understand every piece of the puzzle that goes into building and deploying a webpage.
What this normally results in is the following: 

- Eagerly googling for tutorials on how to stand up a personal website
- Decision paralysis trying to decide what libraries/frameworks to use
- Finally make a decision, get 1/4 through a tutorial
- Realize that in the 2 months since being published, everything in the tutorial is now out of date. Breaking changes result in some things working, others not.
- Spending hours trying to reconcile how the tutorial did it verses how it now has to be done
- Abandoning project and rationalizing that I have too much real work to focus on

**HOWEVER...** after being unexpectedly laid off a week ago, I figured what better way to get back out on the job market than by finally tackling this project, once and for all.

## The Stack

I'm using the following stack for this project

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) and [DaisyUi](https://daisyui.com)

## Let's Get Started!

Before we begin- this post and the entire website were tremendously inspired by [this blog post](https://maxleiter.com/blog/build-a-blog-with-nextjs-13) by Max Leiter. 
I tried not blatently rip off his design or copy/paste his code... but when it comes to styling, all bets are off! 

*Quick Note: I prefer typescript where possible, so I will be using `.tsx` for my components*

Here's the approach I'm going to take:

1. [Stand up bare-bones app](#create-next-app)
2. [Create structure of website](#create-structure-of-website)
3. [Add some content.](#add-some-content)
4. [Add minimal style. Enough so it doesn't hurt to look at.](#styling)
5. [Deploy project](#deploy) 
6. [Iterate](#iterate)


### Create-next-app

This process feels almost identical to `create-react-app`. It was at this point I decided I'd give Tailwind a try, along with .mdx
files for the blog posts (as prompted by the script). At this stage, I spent some time going over the next.js documentation, trying to familiarize myself with the basics. One thing
that stood out to me very quickly as a bit annoying is the fact that every page has to be titled `page.tsx`. Trying to get dummy content in every page led to 
multiple `page.tsx` files open in VSCode and lots of editing of the wrong file. It's very convenient from an orginizational standpoint to have the file structure of the projecte
emulate the website layout, but I would love the option to be able to define the names of pages per route (perhaps in `next.config.ts`?)

### Create Structure of Website

I'd like to follow a pretty generic personal website structure 

- Home Page:  General information 
- Blog: The real meat of the website
- Projects: Any projects I have worked/ am working on
- About: Get to know me ( And my resume üòè )
- Contact: How to reach me

`Next.js` utilizes a pattern where your file structure for pages maps to the routing structure of your app. For example:

![Directory File Structure for Website](/blog/websiteDirectoryLayout.png)

The root level `/page.tsx` corresponds to the homepage of your app `www.my-website/`

The `about/page.tsx` route would be `www.my-website/about/` and so on. 

In addition to this intuitive approach to structure, there is also the `layout.tsx` file. This file, as the name implies, defines the layout of all sub pages.
If you need extra flexibility, each sub-directory can define its own custom `layout.tsx` 

### Add Some Content

While I want this website to look nice and follow normal conventions, I also want to make sure it has a personal touch. The overarching goal of this website 
is to market myself, but a big part of that is conveying who I am as a person. I don't want the end result to be stuffy and humorless. I wrote the 'Home' and 'About Me'
pages with this in mind. I also just tried to stub out material as a bit of a visual representation of progress. At this point, I haven't added anything fancy 
(pictures, themes, etc.). 

For the blog portion of the page, I want to eventually store the posts in some service such as S3 or storage solution. But for now, I'll just store them in their own directory.


### Styling

There are 2 major things I want to accomplish on the styling front

* Cohesive Theme
* Light/Dark Mode (That BOTH look good. Too often I run into webpages that have light/dark modes, but one or the other is clearly an afterthought)

My inital thought was to use [a color generator like this](https://coolors.co/) to generate a cohesive 
theme. But despite my best efforts, I wasn't pleased with the results. I decided the world would be better off if I chose from some pre-defined
themes, courtesy of DaisyUI. 

![Some of the themes offered by DaisyUI](/blog/daisyUIThemes.png)

The photo above shows some of the many ready-to-go themes DaisyUI offers.
I settled on 'nord' as my light option and a slightly tweaked variation of 'dark'.
I wanted a toggle in my navbar, so instead of going the route of creating a `ThemeContext` and `ThemeProvider`, 
I chose the simpler option of utilizing `document.querySelector` to grab the 
`html` element and add the appropriate `data-theme` attribute

```typescript
"use client";
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
...

const lightTheme = 'nord';
const darkTheme = 'dark';

export default function NavBar () {

  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<string>('dark');

  const handleThemeToggle = () => {
    const newTheme = (theme === lightTheme) ? darkTheme : lightTheme
    setTheme(theme === lightTheme ? darkTheme : lightTheme);
    window.localStorage.setItem("theme", newTheme);
    document?.querySelector("html")?.setAttribute("data-theme", newTheme);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    const theme = window.localStorage.getItem('theme') || darkTheme;
    setTheme(theme)
    window.localStorage.setItem("theme", theme);
    document?.querySelector("html")?.setAttribute("data-theme", theme);

  }, []);
  //Rest of component
```

### Deploy

Vercel makes it incredibly easy to deploy your app. After creating an account, I was directed through a quick process to link a project from GitHub. 
After I selected my website repo, it auto-populated the `Framework Preset` to `Next.js`. Since my project is not nested, I left the root directory as the project root. I don't have any
custom build commands or any env variables, so all that's left to do is click that juicy `Deploy` button and let Vercel take care of the rest!

![Deploying a new app with vercel](/blog/deployingWithVercel.png)

Within a few minutes, the build was complete. From the project dashboard, you can retrieve the custom domain name for your environment to view everything deployed as expected. If everything looks good, promoiting 
to production is as easy as clicking a button!

Each branch created in the project will get its own environment spun up with a unique domain name. Pushing new code automatically spins up a new build. 


### Iterate
