## Background and Inspiration

I've run into a fair amount of brilliant devs in my career. Most, if not all of them, have a webpage. 
For some reason the thought of creating a webpage has always been daunting to me. 
Not only do I lack an eye for UX/UI, but I also find myself quicly overwhelmed by the sheer number of options out there.
It's 'easy' to turn to something such as [Wix](https://www.wix.com/), [SquareSpace](https://www.squarespace.com/), or [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), and there's nothing wrong
with that at all. But for me, I want to do it all. I want to understand every piece of the puzzle that goes into building and deploying a webpage.
What this normally results in is the following: 

- Eagerly googling for tutorials on how to stand up a personal website
- Decision paralysis trying to decide what libraries/frameworks to use
- Finally make a decision, get 1/4 through a tutorial
- Realize that in the 2 months since being published, everything in the tutorial is now out of date. Breaking changes result in some things working, others not.
- Spending hours trying to reconcile how the tutorial did it verses how it now has to be done
- Abandoning project and rationalizing that I have too much real work to focus on

**HOWEVER...** after being unexpectedly laid off a week ago, I figured what better way to get back out on the job market than by finally tackling this project, once and for all.

## The Stack

I'm using the following stack for this project

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) and [DaisyUi](https://daisyui.com)

## Let's Get Started

Before we begin- this post and the entire website were tremendously inspired by [this blog post](https://maxleiter.com/blog/build-a-blog-with-nextjs-13) by Max Leiter. 
I tried not blatently rip off his design or copy/paste his code... but when it comes to styling, all bets are off! 

Here's the approach I'm going to take:

1. Stand up bare-bones app using `create-next-app`
2. Create structure of website. DO NOT WORRY ABOUT DESIGN AT THIS STAGE
3. Add some content. It doesn't have to be polished at this point.
4. Add minimal style. Enough so it doesn't hurt to look at. 
5. Deploy project 
6. Iterate


### Step 1: `create-next-app`

This process feels almost identical to `create-react-app`. It was at this point I decided I'd give Tailwind a try, along with .mdx
files for the blog posts (as prompted by the script). At this stage, I spent some time going over the next.js documentation, trying to familiarize myself with the basics. One thing
that stood out to me very quickly as a bit annoying is the fact that every page has to be titled `page.[ext]`. Trying to get dummy content in every page led to 
multiple `page.tsx` files open in VSCode and lots of editing of the wrong file. It's very convenient from an orginizational standpoint to have the file structure of the projecte
emulate the website layout, but I would love the option to be able to define the names of pages per route (perhaps in `next.config.ts`?)

### Step 2: Create Structure of Website

I'd like to follow a pretty generic personal website structure 

- Home Page:  General information 
- Blog: The real meat of the website
- Projects: Any projects I have worked/ am working on
- About: Get to know me ( And my resume üòè )
- Contact: How to reach me

### Step 3: Add Some content (WIP)

This is the hard part!
