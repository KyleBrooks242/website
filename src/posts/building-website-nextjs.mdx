## Background and Inspiration

I've run into a fair amount of brilliant devs in my career. Most, if not all of them, have a webpage. 
For some reason the thought of creating a webpage has always been daunting to me. 
Not only do I lack an eye for UX/UI, but I also find myself quicly overwhelmed by the sheer number of options out there.
It's 'easy' to turn to something such as [Wix](https://www.wix.com/), [SquareSpace](https://www.squarespace.com/), or [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), and there's nothing wrong
with that at all. But for me, I want to do it all. I want to understand every piece of the puzzle that goes into building and deploying a webpage.
What this normally results in is the following:

- Eagerly googling for tutorials on how to stand up a personal website
- Decision paralysis trying to decide what libraries/frameworks to use
- Finally make a decision, get 1/4 through a tutorial
- Realize that in the 2 months since being published, everything in the tutorial is now out of date. Breaking changes result in some things working, others not.
- Spending hours trying to reconcile how the tutorial did it verses how it now has to be done
- Abandoning project and rationalyzing that I have too much real work to focus on

**HOWEVER...** after being unexpectedly laid off a week ago, I figured what better way to get back out on the job market than by finally tackling this project, once and for all.

## The Stack

For this project I decided to really challenge myself and work with a stack that is largely new to me. 

- Vercel
- Next.js
- Tailwind w/ DaisyUI

## Let's Get Started

This post... well, the entire website, was tremendously inspired by [this blog post](https://maxleiter.com/blog/build-a-blog-with-nextjs-13) by Max Leiter. 
I tried to not blatently rip off his design and only implement things I myself had written (no copy/pasting!) to ensure I understand how everything works--
 But when it comes to styling, all bets are off.
