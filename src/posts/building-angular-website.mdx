## Background

It's been several years since I've touched Angular, so I'm excited to see what I remember as well as what new things
have been added!


## Comparing to React 

One of the immediate differences between React and Angular is structure. Angular utilizes 
an MVC architecture, creating a 'separation of concerns' and providing a rigid pattern for building.
React, on the other hand, utilizes components with 'hooks' (useEffect, useState, etc.) that allow for manipulation all within the 
same file.

I'll be following along with the Angular tutorial provided on their website, then trying to redeploy
my existing website as an Angular version

## Components 

Components are the building blocks of the application. They are comprised of 3 pieces:
- Typescript class
- CSS Styling
- HTML Template

CSS Styling can be done 'in-line' via the 'styles' attribute, or in a separate css file

**Component Composition:** Of course, as your project becomes more complex, you'll want to build things 
that are comprised of multiple components. In order to to this, you need composition. Angular 
components can use the `imports` directive (right word?) when defining a component to specifiy additional
components that they are comprised of. For example, a `car` component might be comprized of `wheels` component,
an `engine` component, and so on.

```javascript
    @component({
        selector: 'wheels',
        template: `
            rimSize: {{ rimSize }}
            color: {{ color }}
        `
    })

    export class WheelsComponent {
        rimSize: 22
        color: 'gold'
    }

    @component({
        selector: 'engine'
        template: `
            type: {{ engineType }}
            horsepower: {{ horsepower }}
        `
    })

    export class EngineComponent {
        engineType: 'V8',
        horsepower: 350
    }

    @component({
        selector: 'vehicle'
        template: `
            <engine />
            <wheels /> 
        `
        imports: [EngineComponent, WheelsComponent]
    })

    export class VehicleComponent {}
```

Here, you can see the VehicleComponent is comprised of the Engine and Wheel components.

**Conditonally displaying data:**

What if you want to only display data if it exists? Or if it is greater than a certain value?
That is where the `@if` syntax comes in. Much like any language, `@if` can be 
utilized in the component template to conditionally display data. 

```typescript
    @component({
        selector: 'conditional-example'
        template: `
            @if (isRaining) {
                <p> It's raining outside! </p>
            }
            @else {
                <p>It's not raining at the moment </p>
            }
            <p> 
                Weather is unpredictable, but if/else logic is not! 
            <p>
        `
    })
```

**Control Flow:** 

Similar to a `for` loop, but for components, is the control flow. You can  use it
to iterate over data, components, etc. 

**Property Binding:**

In order to bind to an element's attributes, you can wrap the attribute 
in `[]` e.g.

```typescript
    <img alt="photo" [src]="imageURL">
```


**Input and Output Directives**

In order for a parent component to be able to pass data into a child component,
the data/attributes in question must be defined within the child component
with the `@Input` directive: 

```typescript 
    @component({
        selector: 'input-component'
        template: `
            My name is {{ name }}
        `
    })
    export class InputComponent {
        @Input name = 'unknown'
    }

    //Usage
    @Component({
        selector: 'app-root',
        template: `
            <app-user name="Kyle" />
        `,
        imports: [UserComponent],
    })
    export class AppComponent {}
```

**Routing**

For internal pages within your webpage, use `routerLink` instead of `href` to prevent full page reload
Requires `RouterOutlet` and `RouterLink` 

**Forms**

For managing forms programatically, choose `ReactiveForms` over `TemplateForms`
