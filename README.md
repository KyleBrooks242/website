# website
A React/Next.js website to showcase side projects. display blog posts, etc. 

## Goals of this project
Being unexpectedly thrust into the job market calls for somewhere to showcase current technical chops... 
What better way to do that than through a simple website featuring a blog, existing/current projects, and my contact info?

The main goal here is to get some semblance of a website up that can pull blog posts from some form of DB (DynamoDB, MongoDB, TBD_DB...)
It would also be nice to have an up-to-date resume, with functionality for the admin to easily upload new versions... and perhaps store the old ones?
I would also like to implement some sort of page/tab that can display existing react projects, either screenshots or somehow drop the full projects in. TBD

You WILL fill out this README better when the time comes!
